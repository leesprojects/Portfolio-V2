# Portfolio Version 2

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite TS-SWC SCSS](https://vitejs.dev/).

Now that I am comfortable with Angular, I've decided to revisit React to further improve my knowledge and skills. 
My original [portfolio](https://github.com/leesprojects/Portfolio-LeeStevens.xyz) was developed with just React when I was first learning web development so this v2 should be significantly better.
Although this is a portfolio, I am currently developing it purely as a hobby project and am not looking for a new role.
